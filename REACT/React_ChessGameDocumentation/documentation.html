    <h3>Explaining starter code: </h3>
    <br>
    <p>First, in the html file we add the links for encorperating react and also add a div object with the id root to hold the react canvas</p>
    <img src="HtmlFile.png" alt="html"></img>
    <p>Then in the javascript file we first have the 2D array that initializes all the pieces</p>
    <img src="Initialize.png" alt="Initialize"></img>
    <p>Then each chess piece in the array is overwritten by an image that represents said piece</p>
    <img src="Pieces to images.png" alt="Piece to image"></img>
    <p>Then the Game function. First of all, the React.useState hook allows the Game function to remember things after re rendering such as the state of where the pieces are and if a piece is selected or not. <br>
    Then using the coordinates of the selected piece, the handle clicks function is called and has 2 jobs. If selected square is null that means the handle click function must set the selected square to what the user has clicked. If selected square is not null, the handle click function creates a newgame to store all the new information in, and then moves the piece selected to the user selected row and column. After this, the setgame sets the newly stored s=game state to be newgame and reinitializes selected square. <br>
    Finally, the board is rendered with the last statement, passing the game state, the handle click function, and the currently selected square into a div that displays the board object. </p>
    <img src="GameFunc.png" alt="Game"></img>
    <p>Then the Board function. This function is passed the game state array, the handle click function in the form of onsquareclick, and the currently selected square <br>
    This function wraps the chessboard in one big div and inside this div it iterates throughout each row of the chessboard, wrapping each individual square (array object) in another div which is given the flex property to ensure the squares are neatly side by side. Each row is given a unique colIndex identifier for rendering <br>
    Next, the individual squares must be rendered. Each square is also given a unique identity from its col index. Value tells the square what to display, and the onClick event is used here to call the onsquareclick function when the square is clicked. The isLight is to determine which squares will be a light color or not. Finally, the isSelected is true if the selected square's index is the same as the current square's index, false if not.</p>
    <img src="BoardFunc.png" alt="Board"></img>
    <p>Then Finally the square function. This function is passed the established parameters (props) from the board function being the value, onclick, isLight, and isSelected. This function starts off with some css styling determining the look of each square. Most notably it uses the isSelected to determine a highlight color and the islight function to swap between light and dark rendered squares. Furthermore, if value isnt null, the function sets the square to have an image inside it which is the piece value is depicting. Finally, the function makes the square a clickable button that triggers the onClick function call. Then the react canvas is inserted into the div id root element that was set up in the html file.</p>

    <h3>Enhancements: </h3>
    <br>
    <p>First of all, I wanted to add very base level move validation to get each piece to move in the correct direction, so I made a HandleValidation function within the game function that is passed the values of game, the selected square's index, and the index of the square the piece selected is moving to. Since game is the array containing the game state, the index of the selected square in game equals the current piece which I made a variable. Then, I used a switch statement with cases for each black and white piece to determine which piece's movement logic we need based on the piece variable. Pawns move once and forward (for now), bishops move on diagonals, knight moves in L shape, king moves in a box, rooks move vertical or horizontal, and the queen is a combination of the king, bishop, and rook. <br>
    Then I set it to be called in the handleClick function so that a piece is only moved if the move is valid, else the window will display an alert.</p>
    <img src="Validate1.png" alt="Validate1"></img>
    <img src="Validate2.png" alt="Validate2"></img>
    <img src="ValidateUse.png" alt="Use Validate"></img>
    <p>Next I made the pawns able to move twice only if they are in thier starting positions to finish the basic movement logic.</p>
    <img src="PawnMove.png" alt="Pawn Movement"></img>
    <p>After basic movement logic, I wanted to work on allowing turns. So I created a new initial variable named initialturn and set it to white. Then I used a useState hook to store the current turn and then be able to set it, giving turn the initial value of initial turn. To handle making moves out of turn invalid, I turned to my validation function again, using the javascript toLowerCase and toUpperCase to check if turns are properly being taken (checking that we are not moving a lowercase piece on a white turn and vice versa) <br>
    After writing this, I simply added the parameter turn to the validation function therefore making out of turn moves invalid. I used setTurn from the useState hook and a conditional statement to swap turns over. Also made selectedsquare == null after the alert so players wouldnt get stuck in a move invalid loop</p>
    <img src="AddTurn.png" alt="Adding Turns"></img>
    <img src="SwitchTurn.png" alt="Turn Switching"></img>
    <p>After working turns, I felt this was a good place to implement path checking to the bishop, rook, and queen so that they dont jump over pieces. So, I made a PathCheck function that takes the current game state and the current/destination rows and columns. First I knew I needed a counter so I decided to use the Math.sign function to determine what direction each piece was trying to move based on row and column. Then I used those directions to track the current square in a while loop that loops until reaching the destination row and column of the piece, or if the square at game[currentrow][currentcol] was occupied, if it is occupied, the function returns false, but if there is nothing in the way, it returns true. <br>
    Then I simply called this function as a condition for the bishop, rook, and queen movement.</p>
    <img src="CheckPath.png" alt="Path check Function"></img>
    <p>Then I added basic pawn movement with checking if a piece is one square diagonal away from a pawn and also checking if a piece is in front of a pawn blocking it</p>
    <img src="PawnRestrict.png"></img>
    <img src="PawnCapture.png"></img>
    <p>Then I wanted a visual tracking of the turn. So I created a turn track function to be inserted into a div that displays the current turn. I defined its style and returned a div to be rendered later within another div.</p>
    <img src="TurnTrackFunc.png"></img>
    <p>I decided to insert the Turn tracker inside the div that renders the board and also insert any subsequent buttons into here. </p>
    <img src="RenderTurnTrack.png"></img>
    <p>After the turn tracking, I added a start and restart button each calling a respective function to start and restart the game. I created a new hook to cycle between a started state in order to allow my start and restart button to start the game. My start button simpily swaps started from false to true and my restart button reinitializes everything. </p>
    <img src="Buttons.png"></img>
    <p>Next I quickly fixed the pieces capturing thier own color.</p>
    <img src="PrevOwnCap.png"></img>
    <p>Finally, to finish the game I needed logic to capture the king and end the game. I created another hook to track the gameState of ongoing or checkmate and created a KingCaptured function with the parameters of game and color. This function attempts to find the king of the opposite color every turn (called in the handleClick function) and if it cannot find the king, Then the game must be finished as the king has been captured, setting the gamestate to checkmate which stops the game and alerts the user which color has won</p>
    <img src="GameState.png"></img>
    <img src="KingCapFunc.png"></img>
    <img src="checkEnd.png"></img>
    <p>As my last addition, I added text to speech to nearly every interaction in the game. I created a GameCords array mirroring the game array for the text to speech to read. Then I made a speak function with parameters of sentence and Speaking so I could simpily pass it any string in its call and it could be read by the text to speech. As for implementation, I made text and speech do the following: State start and restart of the game, say which piece is selected/deselected by the user and where, say which pieces move and where, say if a move was invalid to go along with the alert, say whos turn it is after a move, and say when the game ends and who won. I then added a button to toggle the text to speech on and off using another useState hook to set Speaking from true to false and a Speech function to call on click of the button</p>

    <h3>Summary: </h3>
    <br>
    <p>The chess game features the qualities of basic chess without any special rules. All basic moves work as expected as well as capturing, capturing the king ends the game. The window will alert the user when making an invalid move or if someone wins. Text to speech is available for almost every action as well. There are start and restart buttons that show up depending on thier need and also a toggle text to speech function. The turn is also kept track of at the top of the screen.</p>  
    <h3>Reflection: </h3>
    <br>
    <p>I found this assignment easier than the canvas game despite it being much more logic intensive. I feel like Javascript is coming to me easier and I even learned chess as a consequence of this assignment. React was not nearly as difficult to work with as the base canvas was. The most trouble I had was thinking of solutions for the movement of the pieces which resulted in a huge amount of code and logic to fully get basic movement working. in particular the algorithm to check if there were other pieces in the way of the piece being moved was very challenging as visualizing how to cover every piece's path checking in one function so I didnt have to code each pieces check separately took a long time. However, this was a valuable learning experience and it is clear that I am getting more comfortable applying the coding knowledge ive learned at this college. </p>
