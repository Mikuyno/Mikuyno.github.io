<h3>Explaining starter code: </h3>
<p>First, in the html file we add the links for encorperating react and also add a div object with the id root to hold the react canvas</p>
<img src="HtmlFile.png" alt="html"></img>
<p>Then in the javascript file we first have the 2D array that initializes all the pieces</p>

<p>Then each chess piece in the array is overwritten by an image that represents said piece</p>
<img src="Pieces to images.png" alt="Piece to image"></img>
<p>Then the Game function. First of all, the React.useState allows the Game function to remember things after re rendering such as the state of where the pieces are and if a piece is selected or not. <br>
Then using the coordinates of the selected piece, the handle clicks function is called and has 2 jobs. If selected square is null that means the handle click function must set the selected square to what the user has clicked. If selected square is not null, the handle click function creates a newgame to store all the new information in, and then moves the piece selected to the user selected row and column. After this, the setgame sets the newly stored s=game state to be newgame and reinitializes selected square. <br>
Finally, the board is rendered with the last statement, passing the game state, the handle click function, and the currently selected square into a div that displays the board object. </p>

<p>Then the Board function. This function is passed the game state array, the handle click function in the form of onsquareclick, and the currently selected square <br>
This function wraps the chessboard in one big div and inside this div it iterates throughout each row of the chessboard, wrapping each individual square (array object) in another div which is given the flex property to ensure the squares are neatly side by side. Each row is given a unique colIndex identifier for rendering <br>
Next, the individual squares must be rendered. Each square is also given a unique identity from its col index. Value tells the square what to display, and the onClick event is used here to call the onsquareclick function when the square is clicked. The isLight is to determine which squares will be a light color or not. Finally, the isSelected is true if the selected square's index is the same as the current square's index, false if not.</p>

<p>Then Finally the square function. This function is passed the established parameters from the board function being the value, onclick, isLight, and isSelected. This function starts off with some css styling determining the look of each square. Most notably it uses the isSelected to determine a highlight color and the islight function to swap between light and dark rendered squares. Furthermore, if value isnt null, the function sets the square to have an image inside it which is the piece value is depicting. Finally, the function makes the square a clickable button that triggers the onClick function call. Then the react canvas is inserted into the div id root element that was set up in the html file.</p>
