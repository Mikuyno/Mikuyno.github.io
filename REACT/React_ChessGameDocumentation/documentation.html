<h3>Explaining starter code: </h3>
<p>First, in the html file we add the links for encorperating react and also add a div object with the id root to hold the react canvas</p>
<img src="HtmlFile.png" alt="html"></img>
<p>Then in the javascript file we first have the 2D array that initializes all the pieces</p>
<img src="Initialize.png" alt="Initialize"></img>
<p>Then each piece in the array is overwritten by an image that represents said piece</p>
<img src="Pieces to images.png" alt="Piece to image"></img>
<p>Then the Board function</p>
<img src="BoardFunc.png" alt="Board"></img>
<p>Then the Game function</p>
<img src="GameFunc.png" alt="Game"></img>
